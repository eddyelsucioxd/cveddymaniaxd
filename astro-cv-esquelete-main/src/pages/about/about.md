Hi, I'm Henry, a systems engineer passionate about web development. Outside of work, I am dedicated to the design and development of dynamic and static web pages. I am also a fitness enthusiast, frequenting the gym regularly. In my free time, I enjoy board games like chess, where strategy and concentration are key. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth, both personally and professionally.
